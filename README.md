# Airport Authority Data Analysis (Power BI)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes airport operational data using **Power BI** to provide insights into:
- Flight performance
- Passenger traffic
- Delay patterns

The dashboard helps airport authorities monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) and improve operational efficiency.

- Sample dataset created for **academic and internship purposes**

---

## Key KPIs
- Total Flights  
- Total Passengers  
- Average Delay (Minutes)  
- On-Time Percentage  

---

## Dashboards & Visualizations
- Average Delay by Airline (Bar Chart)
- Passenger Count by Terminal (Bar Chart)
- KPI Dashboard using Cards

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Power BI
- Microsoft Excel
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)

---

## Use Case
This dashboard assists airport management in:
