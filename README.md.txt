# Airport Authority Data Analysis (Power BI)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes airport operational data using Power BI to provide insights
into flight performance, passenger traffic, and delay patterns. The dashboard
helps airport authorities monitor key performance indicators and improve
operational efficiency.

## Dataset
- Airport flight data (sample dataset created for academic and internship purposes)

## Key KPIs
- Total Flights
- Total Passengers
- Average Delay (Minutes)
- On-Time Percentage

## Dashboards & Visualizations
- Average Delay by Airline (Bar Chart)
- Passenger Count by Terminal (Bar Chart)
- KPI Dashboard using Cards

## Tools & Technologies
- Power BI
- Microsoft Excel
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)

## Use Case
This dashboard can assist airport management in identifying delay trends,
optimizing passenger handling, and making data-driven operational decisions.

> Note: The dataset used is for internship and learning purposes only.
